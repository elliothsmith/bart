to add:
mark events in plexon
make sure typing like this doesn't register a choice!

priorities:

- read in files
- NIDAQ / plexon mark events
- fine-tune hazard rates, timing (higher mean, lower jitter), growth rate

animated inflation
specify block sequence / trial outcomes from file
hazard rate from file
mouse input
NIDAQ events
"go" signal = okay to click now 
click visual feedback; options in text on left, right

to save/import
hazard rate
random number result
iti/inspection period
rate of balloon growth
initial radius of balloon
scaling of radius with hazard
scaling of points with hazard
rate of expansion for animation

to save each trial:
how far into run we are
rt
choice (stay or go)
result (safe or popped)
points (possible on this run)
block type (type of hazard rate)
points (banked)
